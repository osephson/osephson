# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dedicated Man

I know, big username right?
I'm a **Front End Engineer** based in California. I'm a coding passionate focused on **JavaScript**, specifically **React** & **React-Native**.

## About me

I'm currently working as a Frontend Engineer at [fitzner-consulting](https://github.com/fitzner-consulting). I use daily; **JavaScript**, **ReactJS**, **Git**, **Shell** and **VSCode**.

Nowadays, I'm transitioning into web3 technologies and have contributed to open-source [cardanocli-js](https://github.com/shareslake/cardanocli-js) for Cardano.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely at the gym or surfing the city with my longboard.

## Work Style

```js
while (true) {
  doWork();
}
addEventListener('new_technologies', () => {
  learn();
});
// ERROR: removeEventListener() can not be defined here.
```
