# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dedicated Man

I know, big username right?
I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** with extensive skills and hands-on experience in building web applications with cutting-edge technologies. I'm a coding passionate focused on **JavaScript**, specifically **React**, **Vue.js**, **Angular** for front-end, **Express**, **NestJS** for back-end.

I use daily; **JavaScript**, **ReactJS**, **Git**, **Shell** and **VSCode**.

Nowadays, I'm transitioning into web3 technologies and have contributed to open-source [cardanocli-js](https://github.com/shareslake/cardanocli-js) for Cardano.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely at the gym or surfing the city with my longboard.
